# secsti - Sensors, Controlled Sensors, Timers

Last used on cascada2 custom board 4/20/20. Implemented custom code in general configuration. Secsti was a rewrite of esp8266 codebase concentrating on generalizing numbers or sensors and timers allowing configuration through CONFIG.cpp and CONFIG.h

Next step is secsti2 which will allow microcontroller operation in the absense of wifi.
